A Rust implementation of the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) based on [ash crate](https://crates.io/crates/ash).

## Status

This fork hopes to update the code to follow the Ash builder pattern, and put each step in its own self contained crate so as to better illustrate each step in the tutorial. In addition I also wish to add additional simplifcations in order to make the tutorial easier to follow for less experienced Rust programmers.

In no way is this code intended to be used in a production environment (this code is not optimal) in many places the code is over simplified and over engineered to help make certain concepts clearer.
